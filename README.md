To use this script you must have special key whick one I do not share.
But you can try.


Cloaked in authority, I hold the code to the gate;
A blend of rank and reverence, I dictate your fate.
Whisper my secret, six letters and three,
Split by a colon, the cipher is me.
What am I?

I am the key that unlocks the vault of command,
A phrase that bows even the mightiest hand.
In the realm of passwords, my power is odd—
Decode my essence: three letters, then “is,” then a nod to a god.
What phrase am I?

Neither born nor chosen, I’m typed in the night,
My letters arranged to keep secrets from sight.
My first half leads armies, my second’s divine,
Together, through colons, our powers combine.
What is this hidden sign?
